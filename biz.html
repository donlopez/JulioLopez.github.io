            <h2>Step 1: Determine Your Business Structure</h2>
            <p>Before registering your business, you need to decide on the legal structure. Common options include sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, or corporation. Each structure has different legal and tax implications, so it's essential to choose the one that best suits your business needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Sole Proprietorship:</strong> This is the simplest form of business structure, where you are the sole owner and responsible for all aspects of the business. However, you also have unlimited liability for business debts and obligations.</p>
            <p><strong>Partnership:</strong> A partnership involves two or more individuals sharing ownership and responsibility for the business. It offers shared decision-making and resources but also entails shared liability.</p>
            <p><strong>LLC (Limited Liability Company):</strong> An LLC combines the limited liability protection of a corporation with the flexibility and tax benefits of a partnership. It shields personal assets from business debts and liabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Corporation:</strong> A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners, providing limited liability protection and potential tax benefits. It requires more extensive record-keeping and compliance with corporate formalities.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Choose a Business Name</h2>
            <p>Once you've decided on the structure, you'll need to choose a unique business name. Make sure the name is not already in use by another business in Florida. You can check the availability of your desired business name through the <a href="https://dos.fl.gov/sunbiz/">Florida Division of Corporations' Sunbiz website</a>.</p>
            <p>When selecting a name, consider its relevance to your business, brand identity, and potential for trademark protection. A memorable and descriptive name can help distinguish your business in the market and attract customers.</p>
